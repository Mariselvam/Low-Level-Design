# Low-Level-Design

## In this repositoy I am documenting the important elements of Low Level Design Interviews

### Important Components or Elements of any Low Level Design Interviews

1. Requirement Gathering
2. Identifying use cases and draw use case diagrams
3. Identifying classes and their attributes and relationships and creating class diagram
4. API design
5. DB Schema design
6. Implementation ( for machine coding rounds )

#### 1. Requirement Gathering
      -   For designing real world entities like Pen , Bird , etc, this step is important to understand and collect the actual requirements from the interviewer
      - Becuase designing real world entities problems will be very abstract
       - For other type of design problems like `design a parking lot` , `desing book my show`, `desing cab booking system` , etc, the interviews will give a definite set of requirements most of the times. These systems can be categorized as **management systems** .If that's not the case, we need to follow the same requirement gather stpes that we followed for real world entities.


#### 2. Identifying use cases and draw use case diagrams
    - Useful for API design step
    - Most Useful in designing management systems
    - PlantUML can be used for this. Online editor for plantuml : https://plantuml-editor.kkeisuke.com/ 

#### 3. Identifying classes and their attributes/relationships
    - this is the important and main step in any low level design interview
    - Mermaid can be used to draw class diagrams. This online editor supports class diagrams as well.  https://plantuml-editor.kkeisuke.com/ 
    - to come up with better class design, understanding of 1) SOLID principles and 2)Design patterns is required.

#### 4. API design
    - It can be REST or GraphQL API design
    - Need to have the knowledge of best practices and convensions used in API design
    - Swagger can be used for this as a tool

#### 5. DB Schema desing
    - coming up with DB Schema desing

#### 6. Implementation
    - this is for machine coding rounds
    - implementing functionalities
    - implementing unit tests
    - following implementation specific best practices
